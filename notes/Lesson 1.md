Getting started: https://youtu.be/8SF_h3xF3cE

- Pixspy: a cool tool to know the rgb values of any pixel in image. 
- Rise: A jupyter notebook based presentation. 

Here are the things I got: 
- Fast.ai is a library that is built on top of pytorch. Pytorch is really good. We don't have to replace pytorch, but maybe take help of fast.ai just to perform few task easier. 
- I would not like to learn the library by heart, at least the way I learned Pytorch. Mostly I am looking and going through these videos to have some practical and action based project portfolio for deep learning. 
- As he mentioned in the video that employees in Tesla have to go to through this course to get started, even though they are trained, so I think I am also good and trained but still going through to review and learn some new stuff, hopefully . 

Next task: 
- I have to do a strong project on whatever, i learned with fast.ai, can be classification or segmentation or something else. 
- I can make a starter notebook to change detection using Pytorch and fast.ai as the first blog and exercise to this video. 
- I also need to review the exercise of this chapter 1. 
- I might quickly go through the notebook once.
